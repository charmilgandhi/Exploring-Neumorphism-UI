            <h1>  Exploring-Neumorphism-UI </h1>
            <p>Neumorphism is currently a trend which is gaining more and more attention these days on both Dribble and Instagram. This entire hype started with one dribble shot that went viral.</p>

            <h3>Whats the difference between Normal and Neumorphic UI ?</h3>
            <p>Buttons haven't changed much. But what has changed is the actual cards concept which makes this new style more attractive.</p>
            <p>A Modern Material card usually is a surface floating on top of our perceived background and casting a shadow onto it. The shadow both gives it depth and also in many cases defines the shape itself  and it’s often borderless.</p>
                
            <p>Neumorphic card however pretends to extrude from the background. It’s a raised shape made from the exact same material as the background. When we look at it from the side we see that it doesn’t “float”.</p>
